no metric specified. plan length assumed.

task contains conditional effects. turning off state domination.



checking for cyclic := effects --- OK.

ff: search configuration is EHC, if that fails then  best-first on 1*g(s) + 5*h(s) where
    metric is  plan length

Cueing down from goal distance:    9 into depth [1]
                                   8            [1] --- pruning stopped --- [1]

Enforced Hill-climbing failed !
switching to Best-first Search now.
